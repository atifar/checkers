#Checkers

This is a console application that implements the strategy board game for two players known as American checkers or English draughts. The rules are based on the description in [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_draughts) Wikipedia article, and the rules do not include any of the rule variations. The UI uses the notation from the same article to identify the board squares.

#What you need to run the game:

* A Python 3 interpreter. I used version 3.4.3, but any recent version will likely work. Note that the application is *not* compatible with Python 2.x interpreters.
* The checkers.py file on your local machine.
* A console application such as Terminal on OS X. The font type in the console should support unicode characters. Lucinda Console in the OS X Terminal is one such font, but I encourage you to experiment with the font selection that works for your OS and console application.

To play the game open a Terminal window, navigate to the project directory, then run the following:

    $ python3 checkers.py

Happy playing!
